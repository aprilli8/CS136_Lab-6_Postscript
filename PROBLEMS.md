Answer the following Questions on page 246 of your text in a file called PROBLEMS.md, and submit it with the rest of your code this week. Note that we have added additional text in italics below to help clarify the questions. 

1. Problem __10.3__: Suppose you wish to fill a stack with a copy of another, maintaining the order of elements. Using only Stack operations, describe how this would be done. How many additional stacks are necessary? *(Note: the original stack and its contents should be preserved. After completing the steps that you describe, there should be two identical stacks. You may create copies of elements.)*
